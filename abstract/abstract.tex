\maketitle

In order to avoid well-know paradoxes associated with self-referential
definitions higher-order dependent type theories usually use a
countably infinite hierarchy of universes (also known as sorts),
$\Type{0} : \Type{1} : \cdots$. Such type systems are called
cumulative if for any type $T$ we have that $T : \Type{i}$ implies
$T : \Type{i+1}$. Calculus of inductive constructions (CIC), the
underlying logic of the Coq proof assistant is one such system.

Earlier work \cite{DBLP:conf/itp/SozeauT14} on universe polymorphism
in Coq allows definitions to by polymorphic in universe levels.


- describe the system (just one additional inference rule)

- explain template polymorphism ``semantics'' (MS)

- example of complete + small => preorder, show how lifting + rule for
cumulativity explain the impossibility of applying this to Types@{i}.
